\description{
Returns all videos in channel. Note: As of July 2023, the YouTube Data API
fails to return ALL videos on a channel by getting all videos from the "uploads" playlist
for large YouTube channels. As a result this function's work-around is to pull
all additional playlists from the channel, pull all video lists from all playlists,
and append the result to the uploads return.
